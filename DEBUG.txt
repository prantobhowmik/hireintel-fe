DEBUGGING GUIDE
===============

The extension is not scraping because you're on a job SEARCH/COLLECTION page, not a specific JOB DETAIL page.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
====================

1. Click on a SPECIFIC JOB LISTING (not the search results page)
   - You need to click on one of the job cards to open the job detail page
   - The URL should change to show the specific job ID

2. THEN click the extension icon and try "Scrape Job"

EXAMPLE:
========

❌ WRONG: linkedin.com/jobs/collections/recommended/
   (This is a search/collection page - won't work)

✅ RIGHT: linkedin.com/jobs/view/1234567890/
   (This is a specific job detail page - will work)

HOW TO CHECK IF YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT PAGE:
==========================================

1. Look at the right side of LinkedIn - you should see:
   - Job title (e.g., "Frontend Engineer")
   - Company name
   - Job description with details
   - "Easy Apply" button

2. If you see a list of jobs on the left, you're still on the search page
   - Click on ONE job to open its details

DEBUGGING STEPS:
================

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for messages starting with "[Job Scraper]" or "[Popup]"
4. These will tell you what's happening

MANUAL MODE:
============

If auto-scraping still fails:
1. Click "Try Manual Selection"
2. Highlight the job description text on the page
3. Click "Capture Selection"
4. Click "Save Entry"

This will work on any page!
